## Introduction

We built a MERN Stack walkthrough 3D app and deployed it to Heroku. This project has played a key role in our journey to becoming a full-stack web developers. It showcases collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. In future development we hope to integrate art for purchase and several open world activities such as basketball, tennis etc.
